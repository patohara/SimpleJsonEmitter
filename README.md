# SimpleJsonEmitter
This project is primarily a toy for me to re-acquaint myself with C++, and learn how to do idiomatic C++11 and newer.

The SimpleJsonEmitterBase abstract class provides the functionality for formatting primitive values into JSON, with optional pretty-printing. All the user needs to do is override and implement the 'WriteJson' method.
